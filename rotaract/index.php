              <h2 class="h">ABOUT US</h2>
              <p ><i>Rotaract originally began as a Rotary International youth program in 1968 at Charlotte North Rotary Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States, and has grown into a major Rotary-sponsored organization of over 10,904 clubs spread around the world and 250,792 members in 184 countries. It is a service, leadership, professional and community service organization (often miscommunicated as a Social Service Club) for young men and women between the ages 18–30 (membership will end upon reaching 31 years of age).

Rotaract focuses on the development of young adults as leaders in their communities and workplaces. Clubs around the world also take part in international service projects, in a global effort to bring peace and international understanding to the world.

"Rotaract" stands for "Rotary in Action", although the name originally comes from a combination of "Rotary" and "Interact" (International + Action), the high school level program created by Rotary International in 1962.

Most Rotaract activities take place at the club level. Rotaract clubs hold formal meetings, usually every two weeks, which feature speakers, special outings, social activities, discussions or visits to other clubs. Club members get together on designated days for service project work, social events, or professional/leadership development workshops.

To be eligible for membership, prospective members must be 18–30 years of age, show that they are committed to Rotaract, and show that they are of good standing in the community. After being approved by the club, prospective members are 'inducted' to become members, also known as 'Rotaractors'.

The avenues of service include Club Service, Community Service, International Service and Professional Development. </i></p>
             <br> <h2 class="h"  >Multidistrict communication and MDIOs</h2>
              <p ><i>Rotaract multidistrict information organizations (MDIOs) function as regional resource centers for Rotaractors. They comprise Rotaract clubs in two or more districts, within a country or across several countries. MDIOs are formed to disseminate information and facilitate communication among Rotaract clubs in the participating districts.

Rotaract MDIOs are excellent ways for communicating program updates, local and international news, and event bulletins. They also facilitate uniting Rotaractors from different clubs and districts within a particular region.

MDIOs offer information in the form of publications, Internet services, and direct links with Rotary International (RI) staff. The Worldwide Rotaract Directory has information on specific names, districts, and contacts.        </i></p>
             <br> <h2 class="h"  >What’s involved?</h2>
      <p ><i>Rotaract members decide how to organize and run their clubs, manage their own funds, and plan and carry out activities and service projects. Rotary club sponsors offer guidance and support and work with your club as partners in service.
